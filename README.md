# ID.me - Technical Skills Assessment
## To Do
* monitoring and dashboards.

## Complaints
* Pulumi's GCP documentation doesnt match reality. 
* There were too many instances where I had to shift the plan in order to create things differtly because one thing was supposed to output a list and it outputted a string, or a dict.
* There were too many times where the doc said it needed one method, but it used another. I'm looking at you .network, .id, .name, and .ip_address


## The Exercise:

* Create an account using the Google Cloud Platform Free Tier

* More information: https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier ( https://cloud.google.com/free/docs/gcp-free-tier )

* It is not expected that your challenge will exceed the provisions provided by the GCP Free Tier

* This challenge must be deployed using Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC)

* Cloud Deployment Manager, Terraform, Pulumi, etc.

* Deploy a web application that results in posting “Hello World” through a web browser client device

* Select the hosting infrastructure service of your choice

* The displayed content should be the result of “Hello World” being stored within a database (hosted on a database or database service of your discretion)

* Any programming language can be used

* Assume that this web application is designed to be available to the general public, with large-scale growth anticipated

* Monitor the application

* Use a monitoring solution of your choice

* Give us a reason as to why you chose to monitor the specific metrics that you did

* Other services

* Any other services that you would like to implement that would be appropriate for the proposed application’s scope

* Collect notes/compile documentation regarding your decisions made and experience in building your web application stack
